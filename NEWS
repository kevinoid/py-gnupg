    *	PYTHON VERSION DEPENDENCY CHANGE:
	GnuPGInterface now requires Python 2.2.

Noteworthy changes in 0.3.2
-----------------------------------------------------------------

    *	Internally use fcntl instead of FCNTL, which is deprecated
	as of Python 2.2.

    *	Small other fixes in code and docs.

Noteworthy changes in 0.3.1
-----------------------------------------------------------------

    *	Thanks to a patch by drt@un.bewaff.net, fixed a nasty
	fatal bug that manifested itself running on Linux.

Noteworthy changes in 0.3.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------

    *	Renamed class GnuPGInterface.GnuPGInterface to GnuPGInterface.GnuPG.
	Note only the class name has changed, note the module name.
	The old class name is still supported for backwards compatbility.

    *	Changed license to the GNU Lesser General Public License.
	Previous license was GNU General Public License.

    *	Added a convenience Process.wait() method.

    *	Lots of documentation changes, with many more examples.

    *	Lots of unittests are now used, with many thanks to the unittest
	module: http://py-unit.sourceforge.net/


Noteworthy changes in 0.2.1
-----------------------------------------------------------------
	
    *	MAJOR BACKWARDS COMPATIBLITY BREAK:
	Major API changes with regards to GnuPGInterface's run()
	method have been made. A much cleaner and more sensible
	method is now used to request which filehandles are 'created'
	and which are 'attached'.  See the documentation and example
	code for details.

    *	The ability to have run() 'attach' GnuPG filehandles
	to already-opened files works now. Really, it does :)
	(I implemented more doctest tests to make sure now).


Noteworthy changes in 0.1.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------

    *	Initial release: everything described in documentation
	works (this is not to say the module is bug-free,
	but that rather there are no "missing features".
