Noteworthy changes in 0.2.1
-----------------------------------------------------------------
	
    *	MAJOR BACKWARDS COMPATIBLITY BREAK:
	Major API changes with regards to GnuPGInterface's run()
	method have been made. A much cleaner and more sensible
	method is now used to request which filehandles are 'created'
	and which are 'attached'.  See the documentation and example
	code for details.

    *	The ability to have run() 'attach' GnuPG filehandles
	to already-opened files works now. Really, it does :)
	(I implemented more doctest tests to make sure now).


Noteworthy changes in 0.1.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------

    *	Initial release: everything described in documentation
	works (this is not to say the module is bug-free,
	but that rather there are no "missing features".
